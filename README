A simple REST API which wraps the FHR service. The front-end is a separate AngularJS application which uses this service
to communicate with FSA's FHR API.

I aimed for the simplest solution which meets the requirements, therefore I only implemented a very simple blocking
version of the FHR API client.
A non-blocking version of the API client can be implemented easily using Spring's AsyncRestTemplate.

Instructions:
- To run the tests: mvn verify
- To run the application: mvn spring-boot:run

Possible improvements:
- Pre-loading or caching the list of local authorities
