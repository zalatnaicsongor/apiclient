A simple REST API which wraps the FHR service. The front-end is a separate AngularJS application which uses this service
to communicate with FHR's API.


I aimed for the simplest solution which fulfills the specifications, therefore I only implemented a very simple blocking
version of the API client. A non-blocking version of the API client can be implemented easily using Spring's AsyncRestTemplate.

Possible improvements:
- Pre-loading or caching the list of local authorities
