A simple REST API which communicates the FHR service. The front-end is a separate AngularJS application which uses this service to communicate with FSA's FHR API.

A non-blocking version of the API client can be implemented easily using Spring's AsyncRestTemplate.

Instructions:
- To run the tests: mvn verify
- To run the application: mvn spring-boot:run

Possible improvements:
- Pre-loading or caching the list of local authorities
